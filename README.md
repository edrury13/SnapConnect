## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 17 or later
- Android SDK 34
- Minimum Android device/emulator with API 24 (Android 7.0)

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

2. Get your Supabase URL and Anon Key from the project settings

3. Run the database setup script in your Supabase SQL editor:
   - Execute the SQL in `supabase_setup.sql` to create tables and policies

4. Update the Supabase configuration in `app/src/main/java/com/example/snapconnect/di/AppModule.kt`:

```kotlin
// Replace with your Supabase project details
private const val SUPABASE_URL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
private const val SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
```

### Android App Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync the project and build
4. Run on device or emulator

## Backend Micro-Service (RAG)

A lightweight FastAPI service (`snapconnect-backend/`) now powers the
Inspiration & Reference Engine.

**Key endpoints (protected by `X-API-Key`)**

| Method | Path | Description |

| POST | `/api/v1/inspiration/moodboard` | Generate mood board from a text prompt |
| POST | `/api/v1/inspiration/style-analysis` | Analyse artistic style from caption text |

See the backend README for setup, seed scripts, and deployment notes.
