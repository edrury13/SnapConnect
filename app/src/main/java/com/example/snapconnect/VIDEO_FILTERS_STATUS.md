# Video Filters Status

## Current Situation

Video filters have been successfully implemented using MediaCodec with OpenGL ES, replacing the previous FFmpeg Kit dependency that was retired on January 6, 2025.

### What Works:
- ✅ Photo filters (Black & White, Vintage, Posterize)
- ✅ Real-time camera preview with filters for photos and videos
- ✅ Video recording with filters applied
- ✅ All AR overlay filters (sunglasses, frames, etc.)
- ✅ Video filter processing with progress indication

## Why This Happened

FFmpeg Kit was the library we intended to use for video processing. The maintainer retired the project due to:
1. Time constraints in keeping up with FFmpeg updates
2. Legal complexities regarding patent licensing
3. The acquisition of MPEG LA by Via-LA creating uncertainty

## Alternative Solutions

To restore video filter functionality, consider these options:

### 1. **MediaCodec with OpenGL ES** (Recommended)
- Use Android's built-in MediaCodec API
- Render frames to a Surface with OpenGL shaders
- More complex but no external dependencies
- Best performance and compatibility

### 2. **Build FFmpeg Locally**
- Clone and build FFmpeg from source
- Include as local library
- Requires maintenance and legal review
- Most flexible but highest maintenance burden

### 3. **Third-Party Video Processing Libraries**
- **Mp4Composer-android**: Simple video editing with filters
- **GlVideoView**: Real-time video effects
- **VideoProcessor**: Lightweight video processing
- Check licensing and capabilities for each

### 4. **Cloud-Based Processing**
- Use services like AWS Elemental MediaConvert
- Transcoder API from Google Cloud
- Removes local processing burden
- Requires internet and may have costs

## Implementation Details

The app now uses a MediaCodec/OpenGL ES-based solution:

1. **Video Decoding**: MediaCodec decodes the input video to a Surface
2. **OpenGL Rendering**: Custom shaders apply color filters to each frame
3. **Video Encoding**: MediaCodec encodes the filtered frames to a new video file
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during processing

### Key Components:

- **VideoFilterProcessor**: Main processing engine using MediaCodec
- **FilterShaders**: GLSL shaders for each filter effect
- **InputSurface**: Manages the encoder's input surface
- **OutputSurface**: Handles decoder output with filter rendering
- **GLUtils**: OpenGL utility functions

### Supported Filters:

1. **Black & White**: Grayscale conversion using luminance weights
2. **Vintage**: Sepia tone with vignette effect
3. **Posterize**: Reduced color levels for artistic effect

## Performance

- Processing speed depends on video resolution and device capabilities
- Typically processes at 1-2x real-time speed on modern devices
- Progress dialog shows processing percentage
- Original video is deleted after successful processing

## For Developers

To add new filters:

1. Add a new fragment shader in `FilterShaders.kt`
2. Update `FilterShaders.getFragmentShader()` to return the new shader
3. Add the filter to `FiltersRepository`
4. Test on various devices and Android versions

### Testing Considerations:

- Test with different video resolutions and frame rates
- Verify proper cleanup on errors or cancellation
- Check memory usage with large videos
- Ensure compatibility with various video codecs
